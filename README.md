# Sawyer's web scraping scripts

Some of these web scraping scripts were part of a talk I gave at the
AmsterdamX Perl Mongers group (AmsterdamX.pm).

Most of these scripts are in violation of the websites' Terms of Use
conditions. They should only be used for educational purposes.

In essence, don't be a dick.
